Hyperparameters fdr=0.01, Cpos=0, Cneg=0, maxNiter=10
Train/test set contains 82 positives and 82 negatives, size ratio=1 and pi0=1




selecting cpos by cross validation
selecting cneg by cross validation

Estimating 0 over q=0.01 in initial direction
Reading in data and feature calculation took 0.09 cpu seconds or 0 seconds wall time
---Training with Cpos selected by cross validation, Cneg selected by cross validation, fdr=0.01
Iteration 1 : After the iteration step, 14 target PSMs with q<0.01 were estimated by cross validation
Iteration 2 : After the iteration step, 25 target PSMs with q<0.01 were estimated by cross validation
Iteration 3 : After the iteration step, 26 target PSMs with q<0.01 were estimated by cross validation
Iteration 4 : After the iteration step, 27 target PSMs with q<0.01 were estimated by cross validation
Iteration 5 : After the iteration step, 27 target PSMs with q<0.01 were estimated by cross validation
Iteration 6 : After the iteration step, 27 target PSMs with q<0.01 were estimated by cross validation
Iteration 7 : After the iteration step, 27 target PSMs with q<0.01 were estimated by cross validation
Iteration 8 : After the iteration step, 27 target PSMs with q<0.01 were estimated by cross validation
Iteration 9 : After the iteration step, 27 target PSMs with q<0.01 were estimated by cross validation
Iteration 10 : After the iteration step, 27 target PSMs with q<0.01 were estimated by cross validation

After all training done, 3 target PSMs with q<0.01 were found when measuring on the test set
Found 3 target PSMs scoring over 1% FDR level on testset
Warning weight for XCorr negative
Warning weight for deltaCn negative
Warning weight for XCorr negative
Warning weight for deltaCn negative
Reseting score vector, using default vector
Merging results from 3 datasets
Selecting pi_0=0.973
Calibrating statistics - calculating q values
New pi_0 estimate on merged list gives 2 PSMs over q=0.01
Calibrating statistics - calculating Posterior error probabilities (PEPs)
Processing took 0.21 cpu seconds or 0 seconds wall time
