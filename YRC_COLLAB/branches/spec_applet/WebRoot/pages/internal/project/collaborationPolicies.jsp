      <ol>
        <li>Collaborations will be 
          undertaken on a first-come basis.</li>

        <li>If a two-hybrid or localization 
          experiment has been performed with one laboratory and another lab requests 
          the same experiment, we will not repeat the experiment unless the originating 
          laboratory has discontinued work on the results or no data was obtained. 
          </li>
        <li>Given the potential for 
          different results for mass spectrometry analysis of protein complexes 
          (based on expertise, cell conditions, etc), we will consider projects 
          involving the same protein complex. </li>

      <p><b><font size="+1">Data Release Guidelines</font></b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Ideally all collaborations 
          with the Center would lead to publications in a timely manner. We recognize 
          that this will not always be the case. We assure you that all data is 
          treated confidentially. Until the release time, only the collaborator 
          will have access to the data. However, given the policies outlined above 
          concerning the duplication of experiments, it is apparent that at some 
          point others, in addition to the individual collaborator, should have 
          knowledge of our results. These are the general policies regarding public 
          disclosure. Data will not be released without prior discussions. Specific 
          arrangements can be made to justify prolonging the release time.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Co-localization:</b> 
          Results obtained in co-localization experiments will be released 12 
          months after completion of the experiment. </li>
        <li><b>Two-hybrid Protein Interaction:</b> 
          In some cases, proteins for two-hybrid searches are suggested to the 
          Center by members of the yeast community, but no experimental work is 
          performed outside of the Center. For these proteins, results will be 
          made available to the collaborator when they are obtained and publicly 
          posted to the Center Web site 1 month later. In other cases, collaborators 
          generate and characterize two-hybrid plasmids or provide reagents, such 
          as point mutants or deletion constructs, to the Center. For these proteins, 
          the public posting will be 12 months after the data is made available 
          to collaborators.</li>
        <li><b>Mass Spectrometry:</b> 
          Results obtained from mass spectrometry experiments will be released 
          12 months after completion of the experiment.</li>

      </ul>
