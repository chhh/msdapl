<yrcwww:contentbox title="About the <I>Yeast Resource Center</I>" centered="true" width="650">

<P align="left">The National Center for Research Resources' <B>Yeast Resource Center</B> is located at the University of 
Washington in 
Seattle, Washington. The mission of the center is to facilitate the identification and characterization of protein complexes in the 
yeast <I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</I>. We provide expertise and access to four advanced technologies: mass spectrometry, 
two-hybrid arrays, deconvolution fluorescence microscopy and protein structure prediction. Through collaborations with 

<B>YRC</B> personnel 
these critical, but costly, technologies are made available to a large community of researchers throughout the country. The 
investigators participating in the <B>YRC</B> include Dr. John Yates and Dr. Ruedi Aebersold for mass spectrometry, Dr. Stan 
Fields 
for two-hybrid analysis, Dr. Trisha Davis and Dr. Eric Muller for fluorescence microscopy, and Dr. David Baker for protein 
structure prediction.

<P align="left">These services are provided to further the goal of a complete understanding of the chemical interactions 
required for the 
maintenance and faithful reproduction of a living cell. The observation that the fundamental biological processes of yeast are 
conserved among all eukaryotes ensures that this knowledge will shape and advance our understanding of living systems.
